This is a curated list of **academic** (!) books and papers on
neural/social program analysis, which promote "Analysis of source code using LLM and ML".
The quotes are mostly of critical nature.

### Neural Software Analysis

Michael Pradel and Satish Chandra.
**Neural software analysis**.
__Commun. ACM 65__, 1 (January 2022), 86–96.
[ACM](https://doi.org/10.1145/3460348):
> "The key idea is to train a neural machine learning model on numerous code examples, which, once trained, makes predictions about previously unseen code."

> "Fortunately, software is written by humans and hence follows regular patterns and coding idioms, similar to natural language. For example, developers commonly call a loop variable i or j, and most developers prefer a for-loop over a while-loop when iterating through a sequential data structure. This “naturalness” of software has motivated research on machine learning-based software analysis that exploits the regularities and conventions of code."

> "In principle, practically all program analysis problems can be formulated in a traditional, logic reasoning-based way, as well as a data-driven, learning-based way, such as neural software analysis."

## How to contribute

I'm not interested in professional or scholar books, web articles, videos, blog posts, etc.
The list must include only academic papers, like ACM/IEEE/etc. conference proceedings or publications in scientific journals.

I use [ACM citation style](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/reference-formatting) with a bolder font for titles.

To find new papers I recommend to use [arXiv](https://arxiv.org), [DL ACM](https://dl.acm.org), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com).
